Final Project for CSC535 Deep Learning at the University of Illinois. For easier perusal, please use Colaboratory link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RlOJ3xCeVmbY2IWGioFI8sgIdsLp3gjR#scrollTo=9vZvxn9nX3Q8

Individual sections comprising important sections of code can be found in repo branches, but I'd rather you use the link above to see a cogent juxtaposition of code, explanations and output.
Please feel free to reach out, I'd be happy to answer your questions/troubleshoot issues with your project!
